    "- The drug Capomulin appears to be one of the drugs in this trial study where SCC tumors ended up being the smallest in the group next to those mice that were treated with Ramicane. There were also more timepoints observed, indicating that the mice being treated with Capomulin survived the whole trial compared to the other drugs that were being tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The test group being treated with Capomulin had a smaller variance compared to its counterpart test groups, indicating that the drug's results may be more consistent than the other drugs of interest, specifically Infubinol, and Ceftamin. They both had a higher variance among the observed final tumor volumes of the mice being treated with ther respective drugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- One subject being treated with Capomulin, mouse i557, was observed to have its tumor decrease in size toward the beginning of the trial. However, as the trial progressed, the tumor did continue to increase in volume. A line chart was only created for this one mouse and to see if this is a trend, it is necessary to create more line charts to reveal it.\n",
